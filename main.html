<h1>Munnar</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge  - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala.
		1,600 m above sea level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile
		British Government in South India. One of the most sought after honeymoon destinations in Kerala,
		Munnar is replete with resorts and logding facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. 
		Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make 
		this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is
		the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will 
		bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 
		2,695 m.
